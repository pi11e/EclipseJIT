Eclipse JIT Project

Integrates the Java InfoVis Toolkit (www.thejit.org) into a simple Eclipse Web project
running on a tomcat 7 server.

Initially, the RGraph sample of JIT is included and will run upon starting the graph.js 
file.

Goal of this project is to integrate a customized version of the JIT RGraph with some form 
of gesture control using the MS Kinect for Windows sensor.
Potential Kinect-related projects to use:
- JNect
- Kinesis.io
